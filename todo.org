EIDOLA RECORDS TO DO
* DONE Fix download links to use bootstrap dropdrown button / or restyle, reimplement the functionality seperately
* TODO Add custom renderer to pagination to use bootstrap style or restyle seperately.
* TODO Set zip file stream
  Setting the zip file stream only works by calling save but can only work if it has the id which isn't available until after_save so we get into a loop. If the before_save call_back is used it works correctly on update as the id exists but on create there is no id so the zips do not show up.
  The next thing to try is to create a processor for the zips.
